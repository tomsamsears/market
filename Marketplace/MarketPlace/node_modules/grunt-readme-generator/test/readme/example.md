// These will run for a long time. So you can see that outputs are occurring in real-time.

// These are just some shell scripts that exit with different exit codes
// one exits with 0, other exists with 1, and lastly 2.
var exit_codes = ["./tests/exit_0.sh","./tests/exit_1.sh","./tests/exit_2.sh"];
